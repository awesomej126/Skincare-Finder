# Skincare-Finder

Asks the user for their skin type (oily, dry, sensitive, or combination) and chooses their cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen based on their skin type. All products are under $20. DO NOT TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. I am not a licensed dermatologist/aesthetician, and I just wanted to do this for fun. Consult your dermatologist or aesthetician for more specific advice. It's a coincidence most of the products are from CeraVe, and all suggestions chosen from online beauty magazine articles and from my own experience (I have oily skin).
